v.1.1
- Added the ability to vote to reroll a map.
- Added Domination gamemode. Teams fight to control as many maps as possible before time runs out.
- Added Message of the Day section to the bingo main menu. This allows for quick informing of updates, server changes and PSAs for known issues.
- Added special in-game ranks obtainable by being a noteworthy member of the larger ULTRAKILL community (mapper, modder, speedrunner, etc), or by having supported the mod on Kofi. If you fit any of the criteria, feel free to reach out to me to recieve your in-game role!
- Added the ability to right click on a level in the bingo card on the pause menu, to ping the level for the rest of your team.
- Changed text on the pause menu to better indicate possible actions (left click to move to level, right click to ping map, etc.)
- When a player (re)claims a level, the new time requirement is now displayed in the HUD message that's broadcasted to all players.
- In the case of a connection error, the client will now try to reconnect up to 3 times before failing and leaving the game.
- Fixed an issue where enabling cheats in the base game, then joining a bingo game, would still show finished levels in a bingo as having cheats used. (This was only a visual bug that would display a level as having cheats used when cheats are forcibly disabled in a bingo game.)
- Fixed games in the game browser always showing only 1 player when there may be more connected.
- Visual pass to make UI elements more in line with UI changes from the latest game update.
