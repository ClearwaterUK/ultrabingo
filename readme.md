# Baphomet's Bingo

Baphomet's Bingo is a modification (mod) for ULTRAKILL that  adds a multiplayer competitive bingo-like gamemode that tasks teams of players to race through levels with the quickest time or highest style to claim them for their team, and to be the first team to claim a bingo by claiming a complete row, column or diagonal for their team color.

# Features

- A new multiplayer gamemode
- Support for Angry custom maps for a bigger map pool, with additional maps regularly being added
- Configuration of game settings and criteria (Time or style, requiring P-Ranks...)

# Download & Installation

Baphomet's Bingo is available for download on [Thunderstore](https://www.google.com) (recommended), and as a download package on GitHub.
### IMPORTANT: Baphomet's Bingo requires the Angry Level Loader mod to function. Downloading Baphomet's Bingo via ThunderStore will automatically install it for you, however if you are having issues, you can manually download it [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/EternalsTeam/AngryLevelLoader/).

# FAQ

### Will there be additional maps added to the map pool?

The final remaining campaign levels will be added upon release, and additional Angry levels that are suitable for the gameplay flow will be added based on community suggestions and recommendations.

### Will there be support for [insert map loader] here?

I will investigate possibilities for support for trending map loader mods in future, however nothing is certain.

# Troubleshooting

### I am receiving an error when the mod attempts to download, or load a custom level.
Inform me of the level name you're attempting to load and I will investigate ASAP. This may point to the level bundle in question being moved or deleted from the Angry level catalogue, and can no longer be used.
